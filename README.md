# Hyperparameter tuning benchmarks 

This repository contains the code for running the experiments reported in the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04728.pdf

Note that the results of this benchmark should not be interpreted to rank the different tools but to test how they perform in typical scenarios (e.g., with minimal code).  
Each tool comes with its own benefits, strengths, and advantages.
